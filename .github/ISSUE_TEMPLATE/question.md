about: Ask a question about Stack usage
---

Do you have a question regarding Stack's usage that isn't covered by the online
[documentation](http://haskellstack.org)? In that case please ask your question
on [Stack Overflow](http://stackoverflow.com) and use
[the haskell-stack tag](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/haskell-stack).
This way your question will be more easily discoverable by other people with the
same question.

Is the question related to Stack project templates? If so, please report it at
the [stack-templates](https://github.com/commercialhaskell/stack-templates)
repository instead.

If you still want to ask the question here instead, please make sure that you
are using the latest release (currently Stack 2.9.1). See the
[upgrade instructions](http://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/install_and_upgrade/#upgrade)
to upgrade.
