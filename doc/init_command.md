# The `stack init` command

~~~text
stack init [DIR(S)] [--omit-packages] [--force] [--ignore-subdirs]
~~~

`stack init` initialises Stack's default project-level YAML configuration file
(`stack.yaml`) for an existing project, based on the Cabal file or
`package.yaml` file for each of its packages.

By default:

* Stack searches for Cabal and `package.yaml` files in the current directory.
  Specify one or more directories as arguments to cause Stack to search them;

* Stack also searches for Cabal and `package.yaml` files in subdirectories. Pass
  the flag `--ignore-subdirs` to ignore subdirectories;

* Stack will not overwrite an existing `stack.yaml` file. Pass the flag
  `--force` to allow overwriting; and

* Stack will not initialise if there are conflicting or incompatable user
  packages. Pass the flag `--omit-packages` to cause Stack to ignore such
  matters while initialising.

If a snapshot is specified at the command line, `stack init` will try to use it.
For further information, see the documentation for the
[`--snapshot`](global_flags.md#-snapshot-option) and
[`--resolver`](global_flags.md#-resolver-option) options.

Otherwise, `stack init` will try to use the following Stackage snapshots in
order of preference, using the first that is compatable: the most recent LTS
Haskell, the most recent Stackage Nightly, and other LTS Haskell (most recent
first).

!!! note

    If Cabal (the tool) has been used in the directory, consider commanding
    `cabal clean` before applying `stack init`, in case Cabal has created any
    unintended Cabal files.
